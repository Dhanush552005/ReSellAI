# 📱 ReSellAI – AI-Powered Mobile Resale Valuation System

ReSellAI is an end-to-end **Artificial Intelligence system** that accurately estimates the **resale value of smartphones** by analyzing **screen damage** and **device specifications** using **Computer Vision and Machine Learning**.

The system integrates **YOLO-based screen detection**, **CNN-based damage classification**, and a **Machine Learning resale scoring model**, all exposed through a **FastAPI backend** and consumed by a modern **React frontend**.

## 🧪 Model Overview

### YOLO – Screen Detection
- Detects and crops the phone screen from the uploaded image
- Prevents invalid or unrelated images from being processed

### CNN – Damage Classification
- Damage classes:
  - `no_broken`
  - `light_broken`
  - `moderately_broken`
  - `severe_broken`
- Outputs:
  - Damage class
  - Confidence score

### ML Model – Resale Scoring
- Inputs:
  - RAM
  - Storage
  - Device Age
  - Brand
  - Body Condition
- Output:
  - Resale probability score (range: 0–1)

---


### Factors Explanation

- **Base factor (0.8)**  
  Standard depreciation applied to all resale devices.

- **Damage weight**
  - No Broken → 1.00
  - Light Broken → 0.85
  - Moderate Broken → 0.65
  - Severe Broken → 0.45
